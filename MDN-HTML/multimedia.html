                <p>
                    But down there it would be dark now, and not the lovely lighted aquarium she
                    imagined it to be during the daylight hours, eddying with schools of tiny,
                    delicate animals floating and dancing slowly to their own serene currents
                    and creating the look of a living painting. That was wrong, in any case. The
                    ocean was different from an aquarium, which was an artificial environment.
                    The ocean was a world. And a world is not art. Dorothy thought about the
                    living things that moved in that world: large, ruthless and hungry. Like us
                    up here
